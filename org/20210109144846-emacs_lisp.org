#+title: Emacs Lisp
#+roam_alias: Elisp

Emacs Lisp is a dialect of the Lisp programming language used as a scripting language by [[file:20210109144507-emacs.org][Emacs]] (a text editor family most commonly associated with GNU Emacs and XEmacs). It is used for implementing most of the editing functionality built into Emacs, the remainder being written in C, as is the Lisp interpreter. Emacs Lisp is also termed Elisp, although there is also an older, unrelated Lisp dialect with that name.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
