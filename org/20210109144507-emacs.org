*Emacs* or *EMACS* is a family of text editors that are characterized by their extensibility. The manual for the most widely used variant GNU Emacs, describes it as "the extensible, customizable, self-documenting, real-time display editor".

 Implementations of Emacs typically feature a dialect of the [[file:20201225161334-lisp.org][Lisp]] programming language that provides a deep extension capability, allowing users and developers to write new commands and applications for the editor. For example, [[file:20210109144846-emacs_lisp.org][Emacs Lisp]].

** Display World Time in a minibuffer

[2021-01-09 Sat]

If you need to cooperate with people from different time zones, this might be helpful.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'time)

(setq display-time-world-list
      '(("America/Los_Angeles" "San Francisco")
        ("Asia/Bangkok" "Bangkok")
        ("Europe/Kiev" "Kiev")
        ("Asia/Tokyo" "Tokyo")))

(defun display-time-world-minibuffer ()
  "Like `display-time-world', but just display it in the minibuffer."
  (interactive)
  (message
   (with-temp-buffer
     (display-time-world-display display-time-world-list)
     (buffer-string))))

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Doom is a configuration framework for GNU Emacs tailored for Emacs bankruptcy veterans who want less framework in their frameworks, a modicum of stability (and reproducibility) from their package manager, and the performance of a hand rolled config (or better).
