#+title: Rust

Rust is a multi-paradigm programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. Rust is syntactically similar to [[file:20201227155936-cpp.org][C++]], but can guarantee memory safety by using a borrow checker to validate references.

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World");
}
