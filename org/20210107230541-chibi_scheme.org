Minimal [[file:20201226211105-scheme.org][Scheme]] Implementation for use as an Extension Language
#+END_QUOTE

[[https://github.com/ashinn/chibi-scheme][Chibi-Scheme]] is a very small library intended for use as an extension and scripting language in C programs. In addition to support for lightweight VM-based threads, each VM itself runs in an isolated heap allowing multiple VMs to run simultaneously in different OS threads.
