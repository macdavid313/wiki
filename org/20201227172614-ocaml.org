#+title: OCaml

OCaml is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language which extends the Caml dialect of ML with object-oriented features.

The OCaml toolchain includes an interactive top-level interpreter, a bytecode compiler, an optimizing native code compiler, a reversible debugger, and a package manager (OPAM). OCaml was initially developed in the context of automated theorem proving, and has an outsize presence in static analysis and formal methods software. Beyond these areas, it has found serious use in systems programming, web development, and financial engineering, among other application domains.
